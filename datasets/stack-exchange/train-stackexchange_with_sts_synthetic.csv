Not really!! So legend has it that if you type in a letter, the first result is either the person you searched for/looked at last... Or if you never have, that person has looked at you! Or they search for you frequently, or both.  ( It also works based on interaction, for friends especially, but I have found this to work for friends who never interact with you, as well as friends of friends who have never had interaction.)  So I conducted a little experiment and found out that the trick does work - but ONLY IF YOU'RE BOTH SEARCHING  for each other! That's the missing link. I had someone view me... Nothing. They were still in position 4 down from the top. I search for someone else, who has not viewed me, and nothing - they're still a low result. But then I search for the person who viewed me on the same day, and boom! Less than 3 hours later, they were result number one when I typed in their first or last name initials!! Incidently, this works for friends, or friends of friends, even those who only have one mutual friend in common with you!  (Important: don't try to cheat by partially typing their name. First initial only, for first or last names! Also, this works for the full-site FB, which I use on my phone as a modification to the mobile FB. It does not work with the iPhone app.)  If you search for someone, friend or not, they will still show in your top 5 results for up to a day or so, then they rank lower and not even show in your top 3 if you don't search again. If you search for someone and they instantly (about 3 hours later) rank 1st after that, they've been searching for/looking at you too! If they eventually drop in ranking, either another one of your friends with the same initials interacted with you recently, or you're the only interested party...  Of course, this will be difficult to track if you're stalking them and click on them several times a day, LOL! But I've found that one single search is enough to set it off. ( I keep track of my searches by using the search log. Clearing your searches can throw off results after a couple of hours, too.) I've tried this experiment on multiple days... Same results.

107,66,"IMPORTRANGE() appears to be the function you want.  From the Google spreadsheets function list :   Google Spreadsheets lets you reference   another workbook in the spreadsheet   that you're currently editing by using   the ImportRange function. ImportRange   lets you pull one or more cell values   from one spreadsheet into another. To   create your own ImportRange formulas,   enter =importRange(spreadsheet-key,   range). For languages where comma is   used for decimal separation, use a   semicolon instead of a comma to   separate arguments in your formula.  Spreadsheet-key is a STRING which is   the key value from the spreadsheet   URL.  Range is a STRING representing the   range of cells you want to import,   optionally including the sheet name   (defaults to first sheet). You can   also use a range name if you prefer.  Given that the two arguments are   STRINGs, you need to enclose them in   quotes or refer to cells which have   string values in them.  For example:  =importrange(""abcd123abcd123"", ""sheet1!A1:C10"") ""abcd123abcd123"" is   the value in the ""key="" attribute on   the URL of the target spreadsheet and   ""sheet1!A1:C10"" is the range which is   desired to be imported.  =importrange(A1,B1) Cell A1 contains the string ABCD123ABCD123 and cell B1   contains sheet1!A1:C10  Note: In order to use ImportRange, you   need to have been added as a viewer or   collaborator to the spreadsheet from   which ImportRange is pulling the data.   Otherwise, you'll get this error:   ""#REF! error: The requested   spreadsheet key, sheet title, or cell   range was not found.""   ""key"" is of course the string in the URL for the spreadsheet that matches to the key= parameter.  I just tested it by creating two spreadsheets. In cell A1 of the first I put a string. In cell A1 of the second I put =importRange(""tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A"",""A1"") and it displayed the string from the first spreadsheet. (Your key will obviously be different.)  (The format of the function may depend on your locale. In France the formula is not valid with a comma, so you'll need to be replace it with a semi-colon: =importRange(""tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A"";""A1"") )  NOTES:   Google currently sets a hard limit of 50 ""cross-workbook reference formulas"" per spreadsheet.

Use filter views in the new Google Sheets  In Google Sheets, filtering your data makes it easier for you to view and analyse data by letting you hide data that you want to temporarily take out of view. The new Google Sheets introduces filter views as well, which allow you to create, name, and save filters that you can use without disrupting how others are viewing your spreadsheet.  Creating a filter view  When you create a filter view, it’s like saving a filter that you can use over and over again.   Open the spreadsheet where you would like to create a filter view.  Click the Data menu, hover over “Filter views…” and select Create a new filter view. You can also click the down arrow to the right of the filter  icon and select Create a new filter view.  Using the down arrows in the column headers, sort and filter the data to fit your desired view. Your filter view will be saved as you make changes.  To close your new filter view, either click the X in the top-right corner of the spreadsheet or click the down arrow to the right of the filter  icon and select None.

369,924,"I figured out a way to do this for Mac users using Mac Mail and address book without needing to download extra software. This works with Mac Mail 4.6 and Address Book 5.0.3. Not sure if it works for other vers or not. This may work similarly for other IMAP Email programs like Thunderbird, but I can't vouch for that.  Here are the steps:   Set up your Gmail account in Mac Mail. Make sure the incoming mail server is ""imap.gmail.com"" You can find this under the toolbar>Mail>Preferences>Accounts.  In Gmail, create a Label for the emails for which you want to extract email addresses.  In Gmail, label all the emails you want per Label above.  In Gmail, go to Settings>Labels and tick off the the box for the new Label you created that says ""Show in IMAP.""  Restart Mac Mail so the new Gmail Label syncs.  Open Address Book. If you use Address Book for your contacts you'll need to back up your contacts because you need to delete all contacts in Address Book. I believe you can do this with File>Export>Address Book Archive. I don't use Address Book other than for exporting Gmail emails so I can't give good advice on this. Delete Address Book contacts at your own risk.  In Address Book, delete all your contacts. You should be able to do this by selecting one contact, pressing Command+a and pressing the delete key.  In Mac Mail, find your IMAP folder. There should be a column on the left side of the window with all your Mailboxes. If not go to the top toolbar, select View>Show Mailboxes or press Command+Shift+M. The IMAP folder will be toward the bottom of the column below ""Reminders"", ""RSS"", ""On My Mac"" etc. You should see the Name of your Gmail account you set up earlier with a dropdown arrow on the left.  In Mac Mail, click the dropdown arrow next to your mailbox. This will show you a list of folders and should show the Label you created in Gmail as a folder. Select this folder by clicking it.  In Mac Mail in the Messages window )which should now display all your emails for you Gmail Label), select all the emails in the list. Go to the top toolbar, select Messages>Add Senders to Address Book or press Shift+Command+Y. All the senders for your Gmail Label should now be in Address Book.  In Address Book you can now export contacts as vCards to use in whatever program you like by going to the toolbar and selecting File>Export>Export vCards. You can even import back into Google Contacts. If you need a CSV file, unfortunately you will need to import the vCards into another program (Google Contacts works) and re-export because you cannot export CSV from Mac Mail.   Hope this helps!

This is not a real spam message, but   rather one that is trying to purposely   get into the spam folder of another   account. This is so that I can ensure   that my Gmail filters are setup   correctly.   ... and a subject line such as:   Test Spam Message 1   I always incremented the number at the end of the subject for each message I sent. This way it doesn't look like a duplicate to Gmail and is actually delivered.  Next, on the receiving account, I decided to go ahead and mark the message as spam. I read in the help that it mentions that marking a message as spam is reversible. They even give an example of how a user might accidentally mark a message as spam, then undo it. This is exactly what I am hoping to emulate.  After marking the first message as spam, all the others (which contain the exact same body and only differ in the subject by one letter) are sent to spam as well.  Once I was done with the testing, I marked all the messages as non-spam. Hopefully Gmail treats this as a user accidentally marking a message as spam and doesn't resort to blacklisting the address or doing something worse.  Update: After trying this again, I had to mark a message as spam twice before anything started happening, and then I noticed weird behaviors on the account that was sending the ""spam"". The account was automatically logged off, and I couldn't log back in for a while.

512,700,"None of the previous answers worked for me. Searching for -subject:re and equivalents seem to match EVERY conversation. I believe this is because that search is positive for the first message in the conversation (which does not have ""Re:"" in the subject line).  What works for me is:   Create a label (I called it ""HasReply"") using the filter: subject:(+re)  Then search for -label:hasreply or -label:hasreply -from:me   The logic here is that the first search will find all of the conversations with a reply. The second will then exclude those - leaving the messages without replies.  Adding the -from:me addresses a corner case where I'm searching a bunch of emails, sent NOT from me, to multiple recipients, and I want to find the ones NOBODY has replied to. Without the -from:me the results will for some reason include conversations where I am the only person who has replied. Adding this would not be appropriate in answering the original question, where the person wanted to find emails he had sent (which this would exclude) and had not received a reply to.  Alas, it is still not perfect. I create and apply the filter (""to matching conversations"") and all is good.

548,322,"Here is a script-based solution which allows one to insert a table with the contents from a given range within a given spreadsheet. I did not try to find a way to sync data real-time, as it didn't seem practical given potentially large volume of data that would have to be transferred with every edit to the spreadsheet. Instead, the script adds a custom menu item ""update data"" to the document.  The script should be bound to the document (i.e., created using Tools > Script Editor in the document menu). The spreadsheet URL, as well as the sheet and range to use, are specified within the script. To embed all the data on the sheet, replace .getRange(rangeName) with .getDataRange() .  When the function updateData is first executed, it appends the table at the end of document. At subsequent runs, it updates the table in place (i.e., if  more text is added after the table, the order will be preserved).  Note that cutting-pasting the table would break the updating process (the script would add a new table at the end) since the pasted copy is a new object. Instead, cut-paste the text around the table.  function onOpen() {   DocumentApp.getUi()              .createMenu('Custom')              .addItem('Update Data', 'updateData')              .addToUi(); }  function updateData() {   var ssUrl = ' spreadsheet url here ';   var sheetName = 'Sheet2';   // name of sheet to use   var rangeName = 'A1:C3';    // range of values to include     var values = SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl(ssUrl)                              .getSheetByName(sheetName)                              .getRange(rangeName)                              .getValues();   var doc = DocumentApp.getActiveDocument();   var body = doc.getBody();   var ranges = doc.getNamedRanges('embeddedSheet-range');   if (ranges.length == 0) {     var table = body.appendTable(values);   }   else {     tableRange = ranges[0];     table = tableRange.getRange().getRangeElements()[0].getElement();     var ind = body.getChildIndex(table);     tableRange.remove();     body.removeChild(table);     table = body.insertTable(ind, values);   }   var rangeBuilder = doc.newRange();   rangeBuilder.addElement(table);   doc.addNamedRange('embeddedSheet-range', rangeBuilder.build()); }  Technical notes   It's also possible to sync the data every hour, in addition to manually. Just add a time-based trigger from Script Editor's Resources menu, so that it runs the function updateData.  One can also adapt this script to be bound to the source spreadsheet instead. This would require changes in how the document is opened (e.g., by URL), but otherwise the logic is the same.  The cumbersome part of the script is getting the handle of the existing table in the document. This requires placing it within a Named Range. Also, it is much more expedient to completely replace the table element than to mess with the entries of an existing table. Since a Named Range is immutable, it is also removed with the table it contains, and then created again, along with the new table.",Embed Google Spreadsheet in Google Document,19,18,5

In Outlook (getting Gmail) I saw the message flagged urgent. In the Web interface, I saw no urgent indication.  I replied to the message from the web interface and from Outlook. In the web interface, the urgent flag was not shown, and did not make it back to the Exchange account. In Outlook, the reply did not have the urgent flag activated, but when I activated it it was visible back on the Exchange account.  So, to summarize .. the Gmail web interface does not recognize the urgent flag, at least not as implemented by Microsoft Exchange. But the Gmail engine does not lose the header data when it is provided by another client.  As an aside .. I find the urgent flag far more irritation than it is worth.  Rarely does ""urgent"" to you mean that it should be ""urgent"" to me. When is the last time that you received a message flagged ""low priority""?  IMHO it is far better to indicate in the subject and body that the issue is urgent or time-sensitive.

The trick is that you can put whatever search criteria you want in the filter's Has the words field. For any other field it will prefix your criteria with the field name. For example, if you type user@example.com in the To field, it'll create the filter condition to:(user@example.com) . The reason it works in the Has the words field, is because it doesn't prefix it with anything. This is because it acts as a normal search on the content of the email.   Create or modify a filter.  In the Has the words field, enter your OR condition. For example: to:user@example.com OR from:user@example.com   This is also the place to put any other attributes you want to match (e.g. label: , in: , etc.).

This way they can maintain the context that their lists provide. And since items can have multiple labels it doesn't conflict with any existing labels either.  Of course, if your lists don't contain any context worth maintaining, a separate list for waiting items works well too.  For updating the state of the dependent card, I suggest Bob Snodgrass's answer of adding a checklist item for each prerequisite card, that says ""Add note on dependent card X when complete"". Or if you need further organization, you could even create a ""Dependencies"" -checklist on the dependent card with items for each prerequisite card. Then people completing the prerequisite card can just go mark their card as done.  The best feature of Trello is how it keeps all the features simple - so that's probably why there's no dependency, since it would make things more complicate. That said, I think a feature to link items (if kept simple and clear) would be a wonderful addition, as it is a basic element of keeping work organized.",How do you handle dependencies between cards with Trello?,54,53,5

1333,1486,"Despite requests for this feature since 2009, the Gmail team refused to implement it.  There are however browser extensions and apps that let you schedule new emails or replies:   Streak is a free browser extension CRM for Gmail and has a ""Send later"" feature (you don't need to bother with the CRM at all). You can conveniently schedule a reply right from the Compose box. I've been using it for about a year and it works very well, except that if I change the Subject line, the message won't go through. You need to go in Drafts and Send it Later from there again, under the new Subject line. Works for Google Apps accounts, as well as Gmail. Best choice.  RightInbox is free for up to 10 emails per month, and supports email tracking via an embedded image (web bug). I've used it in its early stage while it was very buggy and corresponded with its author. You can schedule replies right from the Compose window.  Boomergang is free for up to 10 emails per month. After that, it's $5/mo for Gmail accounts and $15 for Google Apps accounts.  Gmail Delay Send is a script you have to install via Google Docs. I tried it; the process was somewhat convoluted and the tool is rough and immature. It is however fully free and open source, and won't add any additional load to your browser (unlike extensions). This is the most promising and most lightweight solution . Unfortunately, it has seen no development since May 2012 .  Momento Mail is a Google App (not a browser extension), and you have to use their own website. As of November 2013, it no longer works (directs to a blank page after typing in the scheduling and recipient info). To schedule a reply, you'd have to copy/paste the To, CC and email body from Gmail. Quite cumbersome. Their ""To"" field doesn't support the standard address format Name <address@company.com> .

Go to:  Video Manager >> Edit (on the video you want) >> Captions >> (Click on the track you want to download) >> Actions (drop down box)  At the time of writing, there are three file types available:   .vtt  .srt  .sbv   These have different uses in different applications, but are very similar. SRT is probably the most common.  Otherwise, if it is not your video, the best method (only method) is to get the xml file from the Developer tools.  Using Google Chrome in this example, navigate to the video then follow these steps:   Pause the video. Wait for it to play if there is an advertisement.  Push F12 on your keyboard. This opens the developer tools. You may have to click on some empty space in the page so that the video is not active.  Click on the Network tab in the Developer Tools.  Click the transcript icon just below the video. Two items will come up in the Network tab in the Developer Tools.  Both items are titled timedtext? plus a bunch of variables. The second one is typically the one you want.

1673,1765,"I finally figured out the Facebook search bar trick!! So for years there's been this rumor that the search bar is the key to finding out who views your FB. They say it's just a legend... Not really!! So legend has it that if you type in a letter, the first result is either the person you searched for/looked at last... Or if you never have, that person has looked at you! Or they search for you frequently, or both.  ( It also works based on interaction, for friends especially, but I have found this to work for friends who never interact with you, as well as friends of friends who have never had interaction.)  So I conducted a little experiment and found out that the trick does work - but ONLY IF YOU'RE BOTH SEARCHING  for each other! That's the missing link. I had someone view me... Nothing. They were still in position 4 down from the top. I search for someone else, who has not viewed me, and nothing - they're still a low result. But then I search for the person who viewed me on the same day, and boom! Less than 3 hours later, they were result number one when I typed in their first or last name initials!! Incidently, this works for friends, or friends of friends, even those who only have one mutual friend in common with you!  (Important: don't try to cheat by partially typing their name. First initial only, for first or last names! Also, this works for the full-site FB, which I use on my phone as a modification to the mobile FB. It does not work with the iPhone app.)  If you search for someone, friend or not, they will still show in your top 5 results for up to a day or so, then they rank lower and not even show in your top 3 if you don't search again. If you search for someone and they instantly (about 3 hours later) rank 1st after that, they've been searching for/looking at you too! If they eventually drop in ranking, either another one of your friends with the same initials interacted with you recently, or you're the only interested party...  Of course, this will be difficult to track if you're stalking them and click on them several times a day, LOL! But I've found that one single search is enough to set it off. ( I keep track of my searches by using the search log. Clearing your searches can throw off results after a couple of hours, too.) I've tried this experiment on multiple days... Same results.

1681,66,"IMPORTRANGE() appears to be the function you want.  From the Google spreadsheets function list :   Google Spreadsheets lets you reference   another workbook in the spreadsheet   that you're currently editing by using   the ImportRange function. ImportRange   lets you pull one or more cell values   from one spreadsheet into another. To   create your own ImportRange formulas,   enter =importRange(spreadsheet-key,   range). For languages where comma is   used for decimal separation, use a   semicolon instead of a comma to   separate arguments in your formula.  Spreadsheet-key is a STRING which is   the key value from the spreadsheet   URL.  Range is a STRING representing the   range of cells you want to import,   optionally including the sheet name   (defaults to first sheet). You can   also use a range name if you prefer.  Given that the two arguments are   STRINGs, you need to enclose them in   quotes or refer to cells which have   string values in them.  For example:  =importrange(""abcd123abcd123"", ""sheet1!A1:C10"") ""abcd123abcd123"" is   the value in the ""key="" attribute on   the URL of the target spreadsheet and   ""sheet1!A1:C10"" is the range which is   desired to be imported.  =importrange(A1,B1) Cell A1 contains the string ABCD123ABCD123 and cell B1   contains sheet1!A1:C10  Note: In order to use ImportRange, you   need to have been added as a viewer or   collaborator to the spreadsheet from   which ImportRange is pulling the data.   Otherwise, you'll get this error:   ""#REF! error: The requested   spreadsheet key, sheet title, or cell   range was not found.""   ""key"" is of course the string in the URL for the spreadsheet that matches to the key= parameter.  I just tested it by creating two spreadsheets. In cell A1 of the first I put a string. In cell A1 of the second I put =importRange(""tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A"",""A1"") and it displayed the string from the first spreadsheet. (Your key will obviously be different.)  (The format of the function may depend on your locale. In France the formula is not valid with a comma, so you'll need to be replace it with a semi-colon: =importRange(""tgR2P4UTz_KT0Lc270Ijb_A"";""A1"") )  NOTES:   Google currently sets a hard limit of 50 ""cross-workbook reference formulas"" per spreadsheet.

Your friends probably has a somewhat large value to show up first and/or their friends and the value can probably be lowered than a non-friend due to the time factor spent on a non-friend's page. Maybe even clicks is played into the search. There is a complicated formula. Facebook is crazy about this stuff. In the movie, when Mark (facebook CEO) did the site about which girl at school was hot or not, he ask a friend to come up with a formula to determine a winner. With how brilliant facebook has become, I don't doubt for a second that they take into consideration all these factors and 20,000 others when designing this formula.  I liked this guy and I couldn't find his page. Of course he was searching me as well and I'm assuming the reason why I was unable to search him was because he made his page only searchable to friends. (he has a girlfriend that's why and didn't want me to know) When he did allow me to search him, he was the first one after I typed his name.

Changing the names of all these individual files for each set of backups could get a little tedious, so one idea would be to create a new folder each time you backup your boards, and then save a set of exported files into that folder.",Are there any web apps that can keep track of collections of books or movies?

1943,924,"I figured out a way to do this for Mac users using Mac Mail and address book without needing to download extra software. This works with Mac Mail 4.6 and Address Book 5.0.3. Not sure if it works for other vers or not. This may work similarly for other IMAP Email programs like Thunderbird, but I can't vouch for that.  Here are the steps:   Set up your Gmail account in Mac Mail. Make sure the incoming mail server is ""imap.gmail.com"" You can find this under the toolbar>Mail>Preferences>Accounts.  In Gmail, create a Label for the emails for which you want to extract email addresses.  In Gmail, label all the emails you want per Label above.  In Gmail, go to Settings>Labels and tick off the the box for the new Label you created that says ""Show in IMAP.""  Restart Mac Mail so the new Gmail Label syncs.  Open Address Book. If you use Address Book for your contacts you'll need to back up your contacts because you need to delete all contacts in Address Book. I believe you can do this with File>Export>Address Book Archive. I don't use Address Book other than for exporting Gmail emails so I can't give good advice on this. Delete Address Book contacts at your own risk.  In Address Book, delete all your contacts. You should be able to do this by selecting one contact, pressing Command+a and pressing the delete key.  In Mac Mail, find your IMAP folder. There should be a column on the left side of the window with all your Mailboxes. If not go to the top toolbar, select View>Show Mailboxes or press Command+Shift+M. The IMAP folder will be toward the bottom of the column below ""Reminders"", ""RSS"", ""On My Mac"" etc. You should see the Name of your Gmail account you set up earlier with a dropdown arrow on the left.  In Mac Mail, click the dropdown arrow next to your mailbox. This will show you a list of folders and should show the Label you created in Gmail as a folder. Select this folder by clicking it.  In Mac Mail in the Messages window )which should now display all your emails for you Gmail Label), select all the emails in the list. Go to the top toolbar, select Messages>Add Senders to Address Book or press Shift+Command+Y. All the senders for your Gmail Label should now be in Address Book.  In Address Book you can now export contacts as vCards to use in whatever program you like by going to the toolbar and selecting File>Export>Export vCards. You can even import back into Google Contacts. If you need a CSV file, unfortunately you will need to import the vCards into another program (Google Contacts works) and re-export because you cannot export CSV from Mac Mail.   Hope this helps! It's a bit cumbersome, but works for me and is pretty easy after you do it a couple of times.","In Gmail, how can I find the oldest message from a person?",57,56,0

2013,1864,"What I ended up doing, which worked really well, was creating an email with some text in the body:   This is a test of the email system.   This is not a real spam message, but   rather one that is trying to purposely   get into the spam folder of another   account. This is so that I can ensure   that my Gmail filters are setup   correctly.   ... and a subject line such as:   Test Spam Message 1   I always incremented the number at the end of the subject for each message I sent. This way it doesn't look like a duplicate to Gmail and is actually delivered.  Next, on the receiving account, I decided to go ahead and mark the message as spam. I read in the help that it mentions that marking a message as spam is reversible. They even give an example of how a user might accidentally mark a message as spam, then undo it. This is exactly what I am hoping to emulate.  After marking the first message as spam, all the others (which contain the exact same body and only differ in the subject by one letter) are sent to spam as well.  Once I was done with the testing, I marked all the messages as non-spam. Hopefully Gmail treats this as a user accidentally marking a message as spam and doesn't resort to blacklisting the address or doing something worse.  Update: After trying this again, I had to mark a message as spam twice before anything started happening, and then I noticed weird behaviors on the account that was sending the ""spam"". The account was automatically logged off, and I couldn't log back in for a while. This might be an automated measure Gmail takes when users report other Gmail users as spammers.",How can I subscribe to a Google mailing list with a non-Google e-mail address?,118,117,0

2086,700,"None of the previous answers worked for me. Searching for -subject:re and equivalents seem to match EVERY conversation. I believe this is because that search is positive for the first message in the conversation (which does not have ""Re:"" in the subject line).  What works for me is:   Create a label (I called it ""HasReply"") using the filter: subject:(+re)  Then search for -label:hasreply or -label:hasreply -from:me   The logic here is that the first search will find all of the conversations with a reply. The second will then exclude those - leaving the messages without replies.  Adding the -from:me addresses a corner case where I'm searching a bunch of emails, sent NOT from me, to multiple recipients, and I want to find the ones NOBODY has replied to. Without the -from:me the results will for some reason include conversations where I am the only person who has replied. Adding this would not be appropriate in answering the original question, where the person wanted to find emails he had sent (which this would exclude) and had not received a reply to.  Alas, it is still not perfect. I create and apply the filter (""to matching conversations"") and all is good.

2122,322,"Here is a script-based solution which allows one to insert a table with the contents from a given range within a given spreadsheet. I did not try to find a way to sync data real-time, as it didn't seem practical given potentially large volume of data that would have to be transferred with every edit to the spreadsheet. Instead, the script adds a custom menu item ""update data"" to the document.  The script should be bound to the document (i.e., created using Tools > Script Editor in the document menu). The spreadsheet URL, as well as the sheet and range to use, are specified within the script. To embed all the data on the sheet, replace .getRange(rangeName) with .getDataRange() .  When the function updateData is first executed, it appends the table at the end of document. At subsequent runs, it updates the table in place (i.e., if  more text is added after the table, the order will be preserved).  Note that cutting-pasting the table would break the updating process (the script would add a new table at the end) since the pasted copy is a new object. Instead, cut-paste the text around the table.  function onOpen() {   DocumentApp.getUi()              .createMenu('Custom')              .addItem('Update Data', 'updateData')              .addToUi(); }  function updateData() {   var ssUrl = ' spreadsheet url here ';   var sheetName = 'Sheet2';   // name of sheet to use   var rangeName = 'A1:C3';    // range of values to include     var values = SpreadsheetApp.openByUrl(ssUrl)                              .getSheetByName(sheetName)                              .getRange(rangeName)                              .getValues();   var doc = DocumentApp.getActiveDocument();   var body = doc.getBody();   var ranges = doc.getNamedRanges('embeddedSheet-range');   if (ranges.length == 0) {     var table = body.appendTable(values);   }   else {     tableRange = ranges[0];     table = tableRange.getRange().getRangeElements()[0].getElement();     var ind = body.getChildIndex(table);     tableRange.remove();     body.removeChild(table);     table = body.insertTable(ind, values);   }   var rangeBuilder = doc.newRange();   rangeBuilder.addElement(table);   doc.addNamedRange('embeddedSheet-range', rangeBuilder.build()); }  Technical notes   It's also possible to sync the data every hour, in addition to manually. Just add a time-based trigger from Script Editor's Resources menu, so that it runs the function updateData.  One can also adapt this script to be bound to the source spreadsheet instead. This would require changes in how the document is opened (e.g., by URL), but otherwise the logic is the same.  The cumbersome part of the script is getting the handle of the existing table in the document. This requires placing it within a Named Range. Also, it is much more expedient to completely replace the table element than to mess with the entries of an existing table. Since a Named Range is immutable, it is also removed with the table it contains, and then created again, along with the new table.",Strikethrough with GitHub Markdown,19,18,0

2188,1146,"Interesting.  I tested by sending an email to my Gmail acct from an Exchange account, and setting the flag urgent.  Then I looked at the email in the web interface and from Outlook. In Outlook (getting Gmail) I saw the message flagged urgent. In the Web interface, I saw no urgent indication.  I replied to the message from the web interface and from Outlook. In the web interface, the urgent flag was not shown, and did not make it back to the Exchange account. In Outlook, the reply did not have the urgent flag activated, but when I activated it it was visible back on the Exchange account.  So, to summarize .. the Gmail web interface does not recognize the urgent flag, at least not as implemented by Microsoft Exchange. But the Gmail engine does not lose the header data when it is provided by another client.  As an aside .. I find the urgent flag far more irritation than it is worth.  Rarely does ""urgent"" to you mean that it should be ""urgent"" to me. When is the last time that you received a message flagged ""low priority""?  IMHO it is far better to indicate in the subject and body that the issue is urgent or time-sensitive.

2383,306,"If you are talking about searching, then @akira's question is correct. However, it sounds like you are asking about how to use this condition in a filter.  The trick is that you can put whatever search criteria you want in the filter's Has the words field. For any other field it will prefix your criteria with the field name. For example, if you type user@example.com in the To field, it'll create the filter condition to:(user@example.com) . The reason it works in the Has the words field, is because it doesn't prefix it with anything. This is because it acts as a normal search on the content of the email.   Create or modify a filter.  In the Has the words field, enter your OR condition. For example: to:user@example.com OR from:user@example.com   This is also the place to put any other attributes you want to match (e.g. label: , in: , etc.).  This will also work in the Show search options page, however it's easier to just use a normal search instead.",How do you disable the notification alert sounds in the new Google Hangouts?,18,17,0

In order to do that, you will first need to define it as a variable:  var myVar=setInterval(function () { document.getElementById('see_older') .getElementsByClassName('content')[0].click(); }, 500);  Then to stop it, you will simply need to enter the following command:  window.clearInterval(myVar)  You can resume the script anytime by typing the first part again.  Now once it loads everything, you have two options. You can right click anywhere on the page and choose ""save as"" and then save that file somewhere on your computer. Then use Google Chrome to open it when you want to view it later (won't look right in Internet Explorer). This will save the entire chat, complete with pictures and emoticons.

2610,872,"Trello doesn't (currently) have a way to link items directly to each other.  The approach that works for me is to use a ""waiting"" -label on items that are stuck. This way they can maintain the context that their lists provide. And since items can have multiple labels it doesn't conflict with any existing labels either.  Of course, if your lists don't contain any context worth maintaining, a separate list for waiting items works well too.  For updating the state of the dependent card, I suggest Bob Snodgrass's answer of adding a checklist item for each prerequisite card, that says ""Add note on dependent card X when complete"". Or if you need further organization, you could even create a ""Dependencies"" -checklist on the dependent card with items for each prerequisite card. Then people completing the prerequisite card can just go mark their card as done.  The best feature of Trello is how it keeps all the features simple - so that's probably why there's no dependency, since it would make things more complicate. That said, I think a feature to link items (if kept simple and clear) would be a wonderful addition, as it is a basic element of keeping work organized.",How can I recursively set ownership of Google Drive files and folders?,54,53,0

2907,1486,"Despite requests for this feature since 2009, the Gmail team refused to implement it.  There are however browser extensions and apps that let you schedule new emails or replies:   Streak is a free browser extension CRM for Gmail and has a ""Send later"" feature (you don't need to bother with the CRM at all). You can conveniently schedule a reply right from the Compose box. I've been using it for about a year and it works very well, except that if I change the Subject line, the message won't go through. You need to go in Drafts and Send it Later from there again, under the new Subject line. Works for Google Apps accounts, as well as Gmail. Best choice.  RightInbox is free for up to 10 emails per month, and supports email tracking via an embedded image (web bug). I've used it in its early stage while it was very buggy and corresponded with its author. You can schedule replies right from the Compose window.  Boomergang is free for up to 10 emails per month. After that, it's $5/mo for Gmail accounts and $15 for Google Apps accounts.  Gmail Delay Send is a script you have to install via Google Docs. I tried it; the process was somewhat convoluted and the tool is rough and immature. It is however fully free and open source, and won't add any additional load to your browser (unlike extensions). This is the most promising and most lightweight solution . Unfortunately, it has seen no development since May 2012 .  Momento Mail is a Google App (not a browser extension), and you have to use their own website. As of November 2013, it no longer works (directs to a blank page after typing in the scheduling and recipient info). To schedule a reply, you'd have to copy/paste the To, CC and email body from Gmail. Quite cumbersome. Their ""To"" field doesn't support the standard address format Name <address@company.com> . The message won't end up in your Gmail Sent folder, but you have an option to BCC yourself. Least recommended.",How can I create a simple sequence diagram on the web? [closed],96,95,0

This will also allow you to get the latitude and longitude for a location.  I don't know of a good way to make a marker on Google Maps, through the UI anyway.  Right click on a point and select ""What's Here?"" to create a marker, but it will be to the closest thing (business, intersection, address, etc). This essentially performs a search with the latitude and longitude and returns whatever is closest to your search. A URL to do that would be:  http://maps.google.com/maps?q=35.128061,-106.535561&ll=35.126517,-106.535131&z=17  With the q (for query I believe) being the coordinates where you want your marker.

Go to:  Video Manager >> Edit (on the video you want) >> Captions >> (Click on the track you want to download) >> Actions (drop down box)  At the time of writing, there are three file types available:   .vtt  .srt  .sbv   These have different uses in different applications, but are very similar. SRT is probably the most common.  Otherwise, if it is not your video, the best method (only method) is to get the xml file from the Developer tools.  Using Google Chrome in this example, navigate to the video then follow these steps:   Pause the video. Wait for it to play if there is an advertisement.  Push F12 on your keyboard. This opens the developer tools. You may have to click on some empty space in the page so that the video is not active.  Click on the Network tab in the Developer Tools.  Click the transcript icon just below the video. Two items will come up in the Network tab in the Developer Tools.  Both items are titled timedtext? plus a bunch of variables. The second one is typically the one you want. It starts like this:  <transcript>      <text start=""4.14"" dur=""3.049"">my name is doctor john rush</text>      <text start=""7.189"" dur=""3.731"">I'm the CEO and president</text>   This xml file is useful if you want to use the transcript in a web page. Other than that, I don't think you can use it the same way you would use an SRT file. If you are any good at programming, you can easily write up a program that will convert it to SRT.
